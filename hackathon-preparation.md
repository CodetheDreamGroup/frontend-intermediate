# What is a hackathon

--

A short (1-3 day) focused time to work on product/feature idea with a cross-discipline team

--

Usually focused on a single topic or domain.

Example topics could be:
* working with government data
* improving social media dialog
* using the internet of things to improve healthcare
* etc

--

A marketing exercise

Most hackathons have a pitch session at the end and frequently the best marketed idea wins

--

A chance to have fun, think about big ideas, and learn new things quickly

---

## What a hackathon isn't

--

All about developers and writing code

Some teams may not write any code at All

--

A place where good quality code is written

Frequently the code written for a hackathon is really ugly and buggy

--

A solo event  

The best hackathon projects are usually team ideas

---

## Suggestions

--

If you have people you work well with, consider working together

--

Be engaged and energetic  

Having excitement about what you are working on and presenting on makes a huge difference

--

Be willing to try something new

Maybe that is working on a design

Maybe that is pitching an idea yourself

--

Most importantly, have fun
